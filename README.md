# Schedule of Investments

The most important feature of the Carta Investor Services product is the Schedule of Investments.

The Schedule of Investments is the definitive list of all investments made by a fund.

Create a frontend using React, that displays this data in a table form.

### Utilized Material UI, Styled-Components

## MVP features

* Make an API call to this URL for the data: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cranium/d8b83184bf0750f2c834760b7c9203dc/raw/a73a70716951f77b90e84b8848ff1fee46938dd1/soi.json
* Include a date picker to choose a date from which date to pull data (append ?date=YYYY-MM-DD to the URL to simulate pulling data for a different day). If a new date is selected the table should reload.
* Ability to expand/collapse the assets underneath an investment.
* Bonus: Include the ability to expand/collapse all of the investments at once.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
